# Boosted Support Vector Machines
## Usage
python3 main.py


## Install Dash on Ubuntu: 
  
Letâ€™s start by installing the python3-venv package that provides the venv module: **$ sudo apt install python3-venv**

Once the module is installed we are ready to create virtual environments for Python 3. Switch to the directory where you would like to store your Python 3 virtual environments. Within the directory run the following command to create your new virtual environment: **$ python3 -m venv dash**

The command above creates a directory called dash, which contains a copy of the Python binary, the Pip package manager, the standard Python library and other supporting files. To start using this virtual environment, you need to activate it by running the activate script: **$ source dash/bin/activate**

Then install dash with the command: **$ pip install dash==1.11.0**

Everytime you want to use dash, activate the dash environment.

## Install Dash on Win 10 using conda: 

Open the conda command prompt, create and activate a virtual environment and install dash using **$ pip install dash==1.11.0** Again, everytime you want to use dash, activate the dash environment.

To run the app, run app.py, and visit http://127.0.0.1:8050/ on a web browser.
